## Important Information
- Directory to be submitted: `battlecode-scaffold-master/src/team074`
- Other players have their own directories; in particular, the example bot is also in `/src/`

## Command Line Tips
- Things to install: Ant, Ivy (be careful to get Ivy correctly; I had to do some tricky symlink stuff, but maybe it's just because I'm doing command line).
- Compile with `ant build`
- If you get errors, you probably didn't get the Battlecode files, so do this with `ant get`
- If this is complicated, just use Eclipse... make your life easier.
