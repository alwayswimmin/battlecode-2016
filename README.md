## Important Information
- Directory to be submitted: `battlecode-scaffold-master/src/team074`

## Command Line Tips from Sam
- Things to install: Ant, Ivy (be careful to get Ivy correctly; I had to do some tricky symlink stuff, but maybe it's just because I'm doing command line).
- Compile with `ant build`
- If you get errors, you probably didn't get the Battlecode files, so do this with `ant get`
