## Command Line Tips
- Things to install: Ant, Ivy (be careful to get Ivy correctly; I had to do some tricky symlink stuff, but maybe it's just because I'm doing command line).
- Navigate to `battlecode-scaffold-master` to run anything.
- Compile with `ant build`
- If you get errors, you probably didn't get the Battlecode files, so do this with `ant get`
- Update to latest release with `ant update`
- Run locally with `ant run`
- If this is complicated, just use Eclipse... make your life easier.
